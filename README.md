# Dev Instructions
## To run locally:
1. Ensure you have installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).
2. In terminal:
    'npm i mysql2'
    'npm i firebase'
2. Download or clone this repo
3. Ensure you have a "firebaseAPI-DONOTUPLOAD.json" in the same folder as Server.js. It is the firebase config as a JSON, including API key. If you need a copy, check discord (for Team12 members specifically)
3. In the folder containing Server.js, open your terminal and enter `node Server.js`.
4. While it is running, you can access it from localhost:8080
